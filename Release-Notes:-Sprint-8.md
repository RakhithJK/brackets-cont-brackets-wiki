What's new in Sprint 8
----------------------

We didn't add major new user-visible features in Sprint 8. Our main goals for the sprint were architectural:
* Make progress on the extensibility architecture of Brackets
    * Created some prototype extensions in order to see what we need to improve. These have been checked into master in the `extensions/disabled` folder; to try them out, copy them to the `extensions/user` folder.
    * Wrote up some notes on ways we should improve extensibility: [Extension Experiments](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/Extension-Experiments)
* Begin investigating how to instrument Brackets for performance: file open, typing speed
    * Typing speed <https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/Typing-Speed-Mini-Spec>

In addition, we began accepting contributions from the open source community as well as other people outside the original Brackets team. Here are a few of the more notable ones:
* [ryanstewart](http://github.com/ryanstewart) made the sidebar resizable
* [jhatwich](http://github.com/jhatwich) fixed the "dirty" indicator so it properly disappears when you undo back to your last saved state
* [conradz](http://github.com/conradz) made the menus more usable by making it so once a menu is open, other menus open on hover instead of having to click again
* [jrowny](http://github.com/jrowny) started working on a prototype code snippets/templates extension: [brackets-snippets](http://github.com/jrowny/brackets-snippets)

Bugs fixed in Sprint 8
----------------------
See [closed sprint 8 bugs](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues?labels=sprint+8&milestone=&page=1&state=closed). A few other bugs might have been fixed that weren't tagged.

Known issues in Sprint 8
------------------------

* Sometimes CEF's browser cache gets corrupted. If you're getting crashes or find
  that it's not remembering the last folder you opened in the sidebar, you can delete
  the cache folder at ~/Library/Application Support/com.adobe.Brackets.cefCache (Mac) or 
 ...\<username>\AppData\Roaming\Brackets\cefCache (Win).
* Pasting text multiple times adds an extra blank line each time after the first.
* The Brackets native shell sometimes crashes while running unit tests.
* The scroll position isn't kept for files that aren't in the working set,
  so if you browse around in the file tree, you'll always start at the top
  of the file.
* Open and Quick Open don't add files to the working set automatically.
* Resizing the window feels sluggish.
* Autoindent on return may not always do what you want, especially for
  multi-line argument lists in JS function calls.
* Touchpad throw scrolling appears jittery due to issues with the mousewheel
  events generated by WebKit (https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=81040).

Upcoming features
-----------------

Here are some things we're planning to do over the next few sprints:

* Better extensibility mechanism for menu items and keyboard shortcuts
* Finalize which native shell we'll be using in the future for the desktop app
* Investigate using node.js as our native extensibility mechanism in the desktop app
* Continue performance instrumentation
* Add an official Quick Edit editor for JavaScript methods
