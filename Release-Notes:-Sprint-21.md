What's New in Sprint 21
-----------------------
* **Code Hinting**
    * [JavaScript code hinting](https://trello.com/card/2-code-hinting-javascript/4f90a6d98f77505d7940ce88/775): Smart code hinting includes keywords, local variables, arguments, and property names based on nearby code.
    * _Note: If you have been using the earlier "brackets-js-code-hints" extension, you **must** uninstall it -- it cannot coexist with the newer version built into Brackets._
* **Live Development**
    * [Default localhost for Live Preview using Node](https://trello.com/card/5-live-development-on-localhost/4f90a6d98f77505d7940ce88/684): By default, Live Preview now launches an http://localhost URL instead of file:// thanks to a built-in Node.js server. Pointing Live Preview at your _own_ local server remains supported (see File > Project Settings).
* **Overall UI**
    * [Drag & drop to open files](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets-shell/pull/190): Drag files onto the Dock icon (on Mac) or the Brackets window itself (on Windows) to open them.
    * [Remember cursor & scroll position across launches](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/2898): Files you leave open when you quit or switch projects will be reopened right where you left off. Within a session, this also works for files you close and reopen later.
* **Extensions**
    * [Extensions can add new syntax languages](https://trello.com/card/2-support-for-language-extensions/4f90a6d98f77505d7940ce88/773): New file types can be added by extensions, with support for syntax highlighting, block/line comments, code hinting, Go to Definition, and more.
    * Extension developers no longer need to disable the cache using Developer Tools -- reloading Brackets should always show changes made to extensions.
* **Code Editing**
    * SASS code coloring
    * Toggle Line/Block Comment support for PHP, XML, C/C++/C#

UI Changes
----------
No major changes to existing features.


API Changes
-----------
**EditorUtils removed** - ``EditorUtils.getModeFromFileExtension()`` is replaced by ``LanguageManager.getLanguageForFileExtension()``. However, it's usually simpler to use the other new APIs introduced this sprint instead: ``document.getLanguage()`` or ``editor.getLanguageForSelection()``.

**Editor constructor** - The ``mode`` argument has been removed, shifting other arguments over (mode is now determined by the Document). Note: you should not normally need to call the Editor constructor directly.

**Debug menu** - Removed ``Menus.AppMenuBar.DEBUG_MENU`` menu ID. This menu is now defined by an extension and may not always be present.

New/Improved Extensibility APIs
-------------------------------
**LanguageManager and Language** - ``LanguageManager`` allows extensions to define new language support in Brackets without making modifications to core Brackets code. In this first iteration, a ``Language`` can be defined declaratively in JSON as a set of properties including a CodeMirror syntax highlighting mode, file extensions to map to the language, and finally line and block commenting syntax. Optionally, extensions may define custom CodeMirror modes. For an [overview of language support](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/Language-Support) and our future direction please see the [wiki](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/Language-Support).

**Node Server** - See the [Overview for Developers](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/Brackets-Node-Process:-Overview-for-Developers). These are _preliminary_ APIs that will probably change next sprint.

Known Issues
------------
* JavaScript Code Hinting will not work properly if the earlier standalone brackets-js-code-hints extension is installed.
* _Debug > Run Tests_ is disabled in the installer/DMG distributions of Brackets, because the unit test code is not included. To run unit tests, [pull Brackets from GitHub](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets#wiki-getcode) instead.
* Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) by default will not allow Brackets to run since it's not digitally signed yet.  To work around this, right click the Brackets app and choose Open.  You only need to do that once -- afterward, launching Brackets the normal way will work also.
* [#2272](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues/2272): Windows Vista may not allow the Brackets installer to run (you may not see _any_ error message). To work around this, right-click the installer file, choose Properties, and click the Unblock button.
