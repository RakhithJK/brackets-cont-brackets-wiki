What's New in Release 0.44
--------------------------
* **Split View**
    * **[Vertical & Horizontal Split View](https://trello.com/c/WLeAC84F/1290-splitview-landing-in-master)**: View two files side by side or one above the other. Use the View menu or the ![Split View icon](images/splitview-icon.png) icon next to Working Files to arrange. (Note: it is not yet possible to view the same file in both panes).
* **Stylesheet Editing**
    * [Quick Docs support for vendor-prefixed CSS properties](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8739)
    * Fix bug [#9002](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues/9002) - Brackets freezes during Live Preview on a line within a CSS/SCSS/LESS block comment that contains nothing but "}" with no indent.
    * Fix bug [#8966](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues/8966) - Inline editor is blank if your CSS rule contains a vendor-prefixed property that uses a rgb()-like color value.
* **Files and Folders**
    * [Project tree improvements](https://trello.com/c/R5VQiTnS/1353-project-manager-revamp): Many small bug fixes in the sidebar file tree. Notably, it's now possible to right-click files that Brackets cannot open (such as binary files and non-UTF8 text files).
* **Preferences**
    * [New preference: show cursor in selected text](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8972): By default, Brackets hides the blinking cursor when you have a text selection; this behavior can now be disabled.
* **Localization**
    * [Extension name/description localization](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8987): The info displayed in Extension Manager, such as extension name & description, can now be localized via the [`package-i18n` property](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/Extension-package-format#packagejson-format).


_Full change logs:_ [brackets](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/compare/release-0.43...release-0.44#commits_bucket) and [brackets-shell](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets-shell/compare/release-0.43...release-0.44#commits_bucket)


UI Changes
----------
**Working Files** - Image files can now appear in the "Working Files" list at top.

**Project Tree** - Folders can no longer appear selected in the tree - the file tree selection always reflects what's viewed in the editor. Right-clicking a file in the project tree no longer opens it. This means it's now possible to right-click files that can't be opened, such as binary files or non-UTF8 text files.


API Changes
-----------
**Split View** - Many APIs in DocumentManager, EditorManager and PanelManager are deprecated (though they continue to work for now). The newer replacement APIs may not behave exactly the same. Read [[SplitView Extension Migration Guide]] for more detail.

**Coding Style** - Brackets core code should no longer contain any unused variables. The Travis build will automatically fail for pull requests that don't adhere to this.

**ProjectManager** - The `"projectRefresh"` event is no longer triggered. See "File list decorators" below for a new, more robust API for modifying project-tree rendering.

New/Improved Extensibility APIs
-------------------------------
**File list decorators** - To modify the appearance of the Working Files list or the project tree below it, extensions can register decoration providers to add icons or arbitrary CSS. Use `WorkingSetView.addIconProvider()`, `WorkingSetView.addClassProvider()`, `ProjectManager.addIconProvider()`, or `ProjectManager.addClassesProvider()`.

**ProjectManager** - Several API fixes/improvements, including:
* `ProjectManager.renameItemInline()` now returns a Promise to track completion
* `ProjectManager.createNewItem()` no longer ignores the `baseDir` argument


Known Issues
------------
* Activity Monitor in Mavericks (OS X 10.9) says the Brackets Helper process is "Not Responding" even when it's working normally ([#5794](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues/5794)). You can safely ignore this unless Brackets is actually failing to respond when you click or type text.
* _Debug > Run Tests_ is disabled in the installer/DMG distributions of Brackets, because the unit test code is not included. To run unit tests, [pull Brackets from GitHub](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets#wiki-getcode) instead.
