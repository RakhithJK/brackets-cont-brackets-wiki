What's New in Release 0.41
--------------------------
* **Search**
    * **[Replace across multiple files](https://trello.com/c/NbNEOs4S/264-replace-across-multiple-files)**: You can see all search matches first and uncheck any you don't wish to replace. Supports the same exclusion filtering as Find in Files.
* **Stability**
    * [JavaScript code hinting crash prevention](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8155): Brackets automatically stops processing problematic JavaScript files that previously could cause a crash during code-hint analysis.
* **Files & Folders**
    * [Rename on second click](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues/1976): Click the currently selected file in the tree view a second time to rename it, similar to the gesture available in Windows Explorer and OS X Finder.
* **Localization**
    * [Danish translation added](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8237)
* **Ongoing Research** (not implemented yet)
    * [Split view](https://trello.com/c/2DWV5tEX/1277-splitview-migrate-workingset-management-to-mainviewmanager) (early implementation on branch)
    * [Research: Theming Support](https://trello.com/c/LHhAcbcU/1260-c-editor-themes) (pull request in progress)

UI Changes

API Changes

New/Improved Extensibility APIs
-------------------------------
**Search** - Use `FindInFilesUI.searchAndShowResults()` to programmatically trigger a 'Find in Files' operation and show its results in the bottom panel.

Known Issues
------------
* Activity Monitor in Mavericks (OS X 10.9) says the Brackets Helper process is "Not Responding" even when it's working normally ([#5794](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues/5794)). You can safely ignore this unless Brackets is actually failing to respond when you click or type text.
* [#2272](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues/2272): Windows Vista may not allow the Brackets installer to run (you may not see _any_ error message). To work around this, right-click the installer file, choose Properties, and click the Unblock button.
* _Debug > Run Tests_ is disabled in the installer/DMG distributions of Brackets, because the unit test code is not included. To run unit tests, [pull Brackets from GitHub](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets#wiki-getcode) instead.
