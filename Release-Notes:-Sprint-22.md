What's New in Sprint 22
-----------------------
* **Extensions**
    * [Install extension from URL easily](https://trello.com/card/3-extension-installation-url/4f90a6d98f77505d7940ce88/789): Use File > Install Extensions to install from a URL pointing to a ZIP file or GitHub repo.
* **Code Editing**
    * [Word wrap](https://trello.com/card/2-word-wrap/4f90a6d98f77505d7940ce88/270): Use View > Enable Word Wrap menu to toggle (enabled by default).
    * [Auto close braces](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/3040): Use Edit > Auto Close Braces to enable automatically inserting closing `)` `]` `}` `"` `'` characters (disabled by default).
    * [Highlight active line](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/3097): Use View > Show Active Line menu to highlight the line the cursor is currently on (disabled by default).
    * [Improved word-by-word navigation](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues/670): Moving the cursor with Ctrl+Left/Right arrows (Windows) or Alt+Left/Right arrows (Mac) now behaves more like other modern editors.
    * [Scroll up/down via keyboard](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/3068): Use Ctrl+Up/Down arrows on Windows; Ctrl+Alt+Up/Down arrows on Mac to scroll the view one line at a time
    * [Hide line numbers](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/3097): Use the View > Show Line Numbers menu to toggle (still visible by default).
    * Fixed several issues with scroll position jiggling or getting lost
* **Live Development**
    * [Improved reliability](https://trello.com/c/R0ZFrFV4): The connection to Chrome is more reliable and errors are displayed more clearly.
* **Localization**
    * [Simplified Chinese translation (zh-CN)](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/3107)

API Changes
-----------
**Editor indentation** - `Editor.getIndentUnit()`/`setIndentUnit()` are replaced by `Editor.getSpaceUnits()`/`setSpaceUnits()`. They mean the same thing but are now more properly decoupled from tab size settings (see [#3209](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/3209)).

New/Improved Extensibility APIs
-------------------------------
**LanguageManager** - 

* Programming languages can now also be associated with specific extensionless file names (e.g. "Makefile") via the new `fileNames` property on `LanguageManager.defineLanguage()`.
* Extensions can associate file names and file extensions with existing languages that are already defined, via `Language.addFileExtension()` and `.addFileName()`.
* A language can now declare multiple line comment styles (for example, Clojure supports both `;` and `;;`).

**Preferences storage keys** - `PreferencesManager.getPreferenceStorage()` can now accept a module object and automatically generate a storage id based on it. Use `PreferencesManager.handleClientIdChange()` to migrate preferences from an old storage key to a new one.

**LiveDevelopment** - Extensions can force a page reload by using `Inspector.Page.reload()` coupled with `LiveDevelopment.reconnect()`, which is now public.

Known Issues
------------
* [#3241](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues/3241): When deleting large blocks of text at the bottom of a document, parts of the editor may go blank. Resize the window or switch documents to repaint the view.
* [#3207](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues/3207): If you use an earlier build of Brackets (e.g. Sprint 20) after using this build at least once, a few preferences such as Recent Projects may get reset. (You can back up your [[cache folder]] if you're concerned about this).
* Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8) by default will not allow Brackets to run since it's not digitally signed yet.  To work around this, right click the Brackets app and choose Open.  You only need to do that once -- afterward, launching Brackets the normal way will work also.
* [#2272](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues/2272): Windows Vista may not allow the Brackets installer to run (you may not see _any_ error message). To work around this, right-click the installer file, choose Properties, and click the Unblock button.
* _Debug > Run Tests_ is disabled in the installer/DMG distributions of Brackets, because the unit test code is not included. To run unit tests, [pull Brackets from GitHub](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets#wiki-getcode) instead.
