What's New in Release 0.42
--------------------------
* **Themes**
    * **[Editor color schemes](https://trello.com/c/LHhAcbcU/1260-c-editor-themes):** Find themes in Extension Manager, and instantly switch between them using View > Themes. [Learn how to create a theme.](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/Creating-Themes)
    * [Built-in dark mode](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8462): Choose the built-in "Brackets Dark" theme for easy access to a nighttime color palette. Third-party themes can also trigger "dark mode," dimming many parts of the Brackets automatically without needing to style everything manually.
    * Configure font settings: Use View > Themes to set a custom font and font size (the font must be installed in your OS).
* **File Types**
    * [Switch language/syntax mode of a single file](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/6409): Use the language indicator in the status bar as a dropdown to override the language Brackets chose to treat a file as. (These changes are _not_ saved when you close the file; use [preferences](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets#preferences) to permanently treat all files with a certain extension as a different language).
* **Live Preview**
    * [Shortcut to force-reload page](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8080): Ctrl-Shift-R (Win) or Cmd-Shift-R (Mac) will reload the entire page but preserve the Live Preview connection. (Not shown in menu).
* **Replace in Files**
    * [Check/uncheck all matches for a file](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8260): The headings for each file include a checkbox for quickly including or excluding _all_ matches in the file.
* **Extension Management**
    * [Show supported translations in Extension Manager](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/7995): Extension listings indicate which languages each extension has been translated for (at bottom).
    * [Install extension from local .zip file](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8166): Drag a .zip file onto the drop zone in Extension Manager's lower-left corner to install.
* **JavaScript Code Hints**
    * [#8561](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8561), [#8460](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8460): Fixed 0.41 bugs where some files showed no JS hints.
    * [Notification when hints ignore a certain file due to problems](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8269): Afterward, the file will automatically be added to the `"jscodehints.detectedExclusions"` preference; it will continue to be ignored until you remove it from that list.
* **Localization**
    * [Traditional Chinese translation added](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8332)
    * [Galician translation added](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8226)
* **Preferences**
    * [New Preference: Disable code hint providers](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8272): For example, setting `"codehint.UrlCodeHints": false` will disable the hints that appear when you're typing `<img src="...`. [Read more...](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/How-to-Use-Brackets#preferences)
* **Ongoing Research** (not implemented yet)
    * [Split view](https://trello.com/c/atD9BEDl/1281-m-splitview-implement-mainviewmanager-code-for-1x2-editors) (early implementation on branch)
    * [Research: CSS Live Preview new implementation](https://trello.com/c/JWRhHzI6/1356-c-livedev-initial-css-implementation)

_Full change logs:_ [brackets](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/compare/release-0.41...release-0.42#commits_bucket) and [brackets-shell](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets-shell/compare/sprint-41...release-0.42#commits_bucket)


UI Changes
----------
Brackets's default appearance should be unchanged, but you can now use themes to customize your color scheme & editor font (see above).


API Changes
-----------
**Extension descriptions** - Extension descriptions beyond 200 characters are now hidden with "..." by default. Users can click to expand and see the full description. The extension's `keywords` metadata is no longer shown in Extension Manager (but still used when searching/filtering the listing).

New/Improved Extensibility APIs
-------------------------------
**Themes** - Themes are a special type of extension that contains a LESS file instead of any JavaScript code. [Learn how to create a theme.](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/Creating-Themes)

**Extension localization** - Extensions can now indicate which languages they are localized for by including an [`i18n` field in package.json](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/Extension-package-format#details). The supported languages are indicated in Extension Manager below the extension's description.

**Code hints** - Code hint providers that are disabled via preferences will automatically not be called by CodeHintManager. However, if your provider does any additional work on its own, you should listen for changes to the `"codehint.<your provider id>"` and `"showCodeHints"` preferences in order to disable/enable that additional behavior as well. [See JavaScript code hints](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/8272/files#diff-b70d0e44873ab629e0f42bb5f8e093eeR67) for an example where this was needed.

Known Issues
------------
* Activity Monitor in Mavericks (OS X 10.9) says the Brackets Helper process is "Not Responding" even when it's working normally ([#5794](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues/5794)). You can safely ignore this unless Brackets is actually failing to respond when you click or type text.
* [#2272](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues/2272): Windows Vista may not allow the Brackets installer to run (you may not see _any_ error message). To work around this, right-click the installer file, choose Properties, and click the Unblock button.
* _Debug > Run Tests_ is disabled in the installer/DMG distributions of Brackets, because the unit test code is not included. To run unit tests, [pull Brackets from GitHub](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets#wiki-getcode) instead.
