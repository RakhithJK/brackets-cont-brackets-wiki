-------------------------

* **Code Editing**
    * [Drag & drop to move selected text](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/pull/9584): Enable the `dragDropText` preference to drag and drop any selected text.

* **UI Appearance**
    * [Windows High DPI support](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets-shell/pull/502): Brackets automatically renders text, icons, and images more crisply on high-DPI displays (similar to the appearance on Mac Retina screens).

    * [Windows: Improved window positioning](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets-shell/pull/498): Brackets stays positioned onscreen after a monitor is unplugged or screen resolution is changed.
* **Linux**

_Full change logs:_ [brackets](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/compare/release-1.1...release-1.2#commits_bucket) and [brackets-shell](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets-shell/compare/release-1.1...release-1.2#commits_bucket) 



UI Changes 
---------- 
**Split View** - The editor pane that is inactive is no longer dimmed. To restore the dimming behavior, install the [Zen Pane extension](https://github.com/stowball/brackets-zen-pane).


API Changes 
----------- 
**jQuery** - Upgraded from 2.1.1 to 2.1.3

**Event listeners** - Deprecation warnings occur when extensions use `$().on()/off()` on Brackets core modules and model objects. Call `.on()/off()` directly instead, as introduced in Brackets 1.1. (For DOM elements, continue to use jQuery events).


New/Improved Extensibility APIs 
------------------------------- 
**Colors** - Use `ColorUtils.COLOR_NAMES` for a list of standard CSS/SVG named colors.


Known Issues 
------------ 
* _Debug > Run Tests_ is disabled in the installer/DMG distributions of Brackets, because the unit test code is not included. To run unit tests, [pull Brackets from GitHub](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets#wiki-getcode) instead.
