What's New in Release 1.4
-------------------------
* **Instant Search in Files**: Searching across files is faster than ever. Results are now displayed incrementally and updated as you type.

* **Easier Preferences Editing**: All preferences are now available as code hints while editing the `brackets.json` preferences file. Opening a preferences file (**Debug-> Open Preferences file**) will also open the default preferences in a second pane in split mode. This default preferences file will give hand on to user about the preferences and how to use and set values.

* **Disable Extensions Individually**: Extensions can now be individually enabled/disabled from the Extension Manager. Here each extension which has been used will be provided with an option to enable, disable and remove extension from the Extension Manager. 

* **Improved Text Rendering on Mac**: Crisp text rendering on Mac with subpixel antialiasing enabled by default. You can use the older text rendering by setting the `fonts.fontSmoothing` preference to `antialiased`.

* **Greek and Cyrillic Character support**: Updated editor font (Source Code Pro) with improved support for Greek and Cyrillic character sets.

* **Traverse files in List Order**: Files opened in the working set can be traversed in the list order with CTRL+PageUp and CTRL+PageDown.

* **Localization**
   * Translation updates for: Czech, German, Finnish, French, Japanese, Italian, Swedish


_Full change logs:_ [brackets](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/compare/release-1.3...release-1.4#commits_bucket) and [brackets-shell](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets-shell/compare/release-1.3...release-1.4#commits_bucket)

## UI Changes

To Traverse working set files in List order, two new options are added to _Navigate_ menu : 
- `Navigate-> Next Document in List`
- `Navigate-> Previous Document in List`

## API Changes

`PreferencesManager.definePreference` was modified to support code hints.

## New/Improved Extensibility APIs

- `PreferencesManager.getAllPreferences` returns a clone of all the preferences defined.
- `CodeInspection.getProviderIDsForLanguage(languageId)` returns names of linters registered for `languageId`.

Known Issues
------------
* Activity Monitor in Mavericks (OS X 10.9) says the Brackets Helper process is "Not Responding" even when it's working normally ([#5794](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/issues/5794)). You can safely ignore this unless Brackets is actually failing to respond when you click or type text.
* _Debug > Run Tests_ is disabled in the installer/DMG distributions of Brackets, because the unit test code is not included. To run unit tests, [pull Brackets from GitHub](https://github.com/brackets-cont/brackets/wiki/How-to-Hack-on-Brackets#wiki-getcode) instead.
